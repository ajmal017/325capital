    No

    - IC Decreasing
    Yes
        - Are margins and/or ROIC improving?
    - Margin Improvement OPportunities exist? 


# A) Quality of business (High, Med, Low)
- ROIC > 8%
- GM at least stable
- EBITDA at least stable
- Revenue at least stable
## 2) If quality is high
    a) sufficient returns from current EP
    b) requires more EP
## 3) If requires more EP
    a) appears possible with margin improvement (realized or when backing out growth)
    b) will require growth to generate return
## 4) if requires growth
    a) growth investments have been attractive
    b) growth investments have not been attractive
## 5) if 4a)
    a) appears to have adequate growth potential
    b) appears to have insufficient growth potential
## 6) if 5a)
    a) can fund with internal free cash flow
    b) will require additional capital
## 7) if 6b)
    a) expected to have debt capacity
    b) expected to require equity

# B) Sub par ROIC
## IC
    2a) IC increasing
    2b) IC stable
    2c) IC decreasing
## 3) if 2a
    a) looking further back, attractive ROIC before increases in IC (i.e. opportunities to improve margins or clean up balance sheet)
    b) no reasonable historical attractive ROIC
    3b) if 2c, are margins and/or ROIC improving

# C) ROIC okay, but margins declining
    2) Revenue increasing?

# D) Both ROIC and GM sub par

Some test cases to think about:
- unlocking value from recent investments
- cost creep
- expansions into unattractive areas
- no catalyst for continuous improvement
- more growth opportunity than can fund or insufficient capacity to pursue
- recent shock to competitive dynamics

Looking forward to discussing further and fleshing out specifics with you tomorrow.

Be well,
Michael
